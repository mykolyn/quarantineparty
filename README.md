<h2>How it Works</h2>
Afer clicking "Get Woke Stay Woke" on the home page you will be routed to the News and Emergency Shopping List page where you can search for shopping lists for certain distasters and search for news articles in regards to your needs. At the top of the page you can click "map" and you will be routed to the map page that uses d3.js and leaflet.js to render data from a kaggle .csv file to show you the infected count, death count, and recovery count on a world map.
